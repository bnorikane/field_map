# Leaflet Map showing Boulder County Dems Field Districts

This Leaflet map reads geojson file with district boundaries and displays them in an interactive web map

- Boulder County 2022 election districts
- BCDP 2022 Field Team Areas
- 2022 districts created by 2021 Redistricting Commission after 2020 Census

## ISSUES

- Cannot use ThunderForest Mobile basemap
  - simpler and higher contrast basemap
  - seems to conceal overlays

### SOLVED ISSUES

- leaflet-ajax and leaflet-provider plugins are incompatible

  - leaflet-ajax would only work when I removed the leaflet-provider plugin
  - had to use the built in tileLayer constructor

- SD geojson files use urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::2232, not compatible with Leaflet display
  - need to convert these files
  - Leaflet's default projection is EPSG:3857, also known as "Google Mercator" or "Web Mercator" and sometimes designated with the number "900913". This projection is what most slippy tile based maps use, including the common tile sets from Google, Bing, OpenStreetMap, and others. You can easily use this projection in QGIS by selecting "Google Mercator EPSG:900913". Leaflet has some basic support for displaying maps in other projections. Most folks who do that seem to use the addon Proj4Leaflet to perform the projection.

## BCDP Field Map Data
